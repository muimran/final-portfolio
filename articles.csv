Rural poor in Bangladesh fighting impacts of climate change alone,"The raging ‘beast’
As far as the eye can see, the riverbank resembles the jagged edge of a saw. As if, an enormous beast has mercilessly raked the shoreline with its claw. Signs of devastation are everywhere along the riverbank: remnant of a paddy field, ruin of a family burial ground, an abandoned village market. The beast that has been ravaging this locality in the coastal district of Barguna in Southern Bangladesh is the river Bishkhali. The brackish water of Bishkhali surges more than five feet than its regular height during each monsoon season. However, this height has been increasing in recent years due to extreme rainfall, a phenomenon, directly linked to climate change according to the experts.
“That is where my land was. Bishkhali has eaten it,” said Sohrab Uddin, 53, pointing at a patch of the river, on a recent autumn afternoon. A father of three, Sohrab produced multiple crops year round on his land and earned just enough to support his five-member family. However, after he lost his livelihood to the encroaching river, he began working as a day laborer in a brickfield to keep his family fed. Last year, Sohrab’s older daughter, who was in 9th grade, dropped out of school and started working as a domestic assistant in a nearby town to provide extra income to her family. But, in last May, when cyclone Fani, another extreme weather event that is increasing in frequency and intensity in South Asia due to climate change, damaged the roof of his house, Sohrab couldn’t keep his head above water anymore. He had to take out multiple loans from formal and informal sources on high interest rates to repair his dilapidated house. The monetary assistance he received from the government after the cyclone was not enough to pay for the repair costs. “I do not know how I am going to repay all these debts. I may have to move to Dhaka in search of a better income”.
Sohrab Uddin’s misfortune is not an isolated event. Rural households across the country are being most affected by calamities brought by climate change and are left alone to combat them.  According to a recently published study by London based policy research institute International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) hailed as the first of its kind, rural families in Bangladesh are shelling out a whopping US$ 2 billion a year on average to address the impacts of climate change.
 
Key Findings
In Bangladesh, the discussion around climate financing has been so far centered on funding provided by Bangladesh Government and international donors. Contribution by rural households- who are the direct sufferers of climate change- have largely been absent from the discussion. However, according to the IIED report, not only does do the rural households spend a substantial amount of money in disaster responses, they spend far more than the Bangladesh government and the international donors combined. In 2015-16 fiscal year, government spent US$0.88 billion for climate disaster in rural Bangladesh while the multinational donors shelled out around US$ 154 million. Thus in absolute terms, rural household spending in climate and disaster risk reduction is more than twice that of the government spending and 12 times higher than the international financing. The study also finds that household with female heads spend as much as male headed households. However, since females earn significantly less than males, as a share of income female-headed households spend three times more than male-headed ones.
 
Poorest hit hardest
Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change, is also one of the most impoverished ones. According to the World Bank, 1 in 4 people still live in poverty in Bangladesh while 12% of the population live in extreme poverty. Although rural poverty rate has taken a nosedive in recent years, still more poor people live in rural areas than in urban areas. According to UNDP, rural Bangladeshis earn just over half the national average.
This means the poorest in Bangladesh are bearing the cost of climate change most. Already impoverished families in rural Bangladesh are spending money on repairing damaged properties and replacing animals, which they could have used to buy food for their family or pay for their children’s education and healthcare.
“This research reveals an alarming imbalance. It is unacceptable that the poorest people are shouldering the burden of spending for adapting to climate change in Bangladesh,” IIED director Andrew Norton said in a press release.
Atiq Rahman, a Bangladeshi expert who was one of the lead authors of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), told AFP after the report was published that, while the report is an welcoming step, US$ 2 billion was “a fraction of the amount” Bangladeshis and the government spend every year.
“This is an underestimate. There are many climate change-related costs that cannot be easily monetized,” he told, citing the impacts on health, land productivity and livestock.
 
The Way Forward
Bangladesh government has taken a number of positive steps in terms of both climate change mitigation and adaptation, starting with the creation of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) nearly ten years ago. It was also one of the first governments to form a Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) from its own resources to fight the impacts of climate change. However, being a low-income country, its ability to tackle climate change on its own is limited.
At COP15 in 2009, rich countries promised to raise US$ 100 a year by 2020 to help poor countries like Bangladesh fight climate change and a year later Green Climate Fund (GCF) was stablished. However, so far the rich countries have fallen short of their promise. A quick glance at GCF website in late 2019 reveals that it has little more than 100 projects in its portfolio valued at nearly US$ 20 billion.
While rich countries have failed in their promise, governments of poor countries have also their own failure in directing climate finance to local level, according to experts. Dr Saleemul Huq, director of International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) told yesterday to a Bangladeshi daily Dhaka Tribune that only 2% of the global funds reach the most poor and needy people in Bangladesh.
Abdullah Mamun, an expert on poverty in rural Bangladesh said, in the upcoming COP25, to be held in Madrid, Spain from 2-13 December, Bangladesh government has the opportunity to highlight the plight of rural Bangladeshis on the face of climate change. “At the same time Bangladesh can also raise its voice to hold rich countries accountable to their promise,” he added."
No end in sight to the plight of female migrant workers in Saudi,"Earlier this month a video by a Bangladeshi housemaid working in Saudi Arabia went viral in social media. In the video posted to her Facebook page, 25-year-old Sumi Akter said that her employer had physically assaulted her. “I won’t perhaps live longer. Please save me. They locked me up for 15 days and gave me hardly anything to eat. They tied and beat me up and then burned my arms with hot oil,” Akter said while holding burn scars on her hand to the camera. She also claimed that she was sexually assaulted by her employers.
“They often beat me up at my first employer’s home and then they took me to another home where I had the same experience,” a tearful Akter described her ordeal mentioning that she was recording the video in the bathroom in an attempt to hide from her employer.
In spite of enduring this agonizing experience, Sumi Akter can count herself lucky because she survived to tell the tale of her suffering. In the last 4 years, more than 150 women returned dead from Saudi Arabia, according to BRAC Migration Program. Sixty-six of them committed suicide.
In 2017, Abiron Begum left her home in Khulna for Saudi Arabia in a bid to change the fate of her impoverished family. But, her dream turned into a nightmare; she returned to Dhaka on October 24 in a coffin.
In Saudi Arabia, where 40-year old Abiron worked as a domestic helper, she was regularly beaten by her employer. She was traumatized and used to describe her suffering to her family over phone whenever she got a chance to talk to them. Reportedly, her employers inflicted unspeakable torture on her; at one instance, they shoved her head against a hot grill. But her cries for help would met with mournful silence from her family. They had no power to do anything to save her. Eventually they completely lost contact with her.
 
Systemized oppression
Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia work under a system known as Kafala. This is a form of visa sponsorship, in which a migrant is tied to her employer (called Kafeel). She is not allowed to leave her employer without their permission. She is also not allowed to change employer or travel overseas. If she escapes from an abusive employer, police has the authority to arrest and deport her.
The Kafala system grants sponsoring employers substantial control over workers and is notorious for limiting workers’ rights. According to Human Rights Watch, due to the Kafal system, some employers feel entitled to exert ‘ownership’ over a domestic worker. The Same organization also found in a 2004 study that female workers from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and other South and South-East Asian countries regularly face long working hours without overtime pay, physical and mental torture and sexual abuse by the hands of their employers.
“I haven’t found a single case where the employers have been punished. So the Saudi employers think they can do whatever they want with these workers without facing any consequences,” told Shariful Islam Hasan of the migration programme at BRAC to Al Jazeera last week.
According to BRAC, this year alone saw 900 female migrants return home from Saudi Arabia after sexual harassment and physical abuse by their employers. Last year the number was more than 1300.
Bangladesh government, which has long denied allegations of sexual abuse of female workers in Saudi Arabia, also admitted in a report in September that Bangladeshi female workers are returning home after being subjected to various forms of abuse in Saudi Arabia.
 
Exploited at home
One common theme running through all the abuse stories is that when the victim asked for help they received little or no help from the recruiting agencies that sent them.
Golam Moshi, ambassador of Bangladesh to Saudi Arabia, partially blamed the manpower agents in Bangladesh for ill-treatment of some of the female migrant workers at the hands of Saudi employers. In an interview with Al Jazeera, he accused them of luring poor women from the poverty-ridden areas of the country.
“They are untrained and unprepared for a foreign land and culture,” he said, “Thus most of them get mentally traumatized and homesick when they start working here in Saudi households.”
Shameem Ahmed Chowdhury, secretary of Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting agencies (BAIRA), a powerful association of more than 1200 recruiting agencies, denied the allegations made by ambassador Moshi. “There are many government imposed checks and balances in place in the whole process of sending a female worker to Saudi Arabia. It is not possible for a recruiting agency alone to buck the system and lure women with false information, we only send women who are willing to go,” said BAIRA secretary. “The government should make sure those checks and balances are functioning properly, instead of wholesale blaming us,” he added.
Mizanur Rahman, managing director of Elegant Overseas, a Dhaka based manpower recruiting agency, said he is always cautious about where he is sending the workers. “If one of the female workers return to Bangladesh due to abuse or other issues, I am liable to pay her return ticket and sometimes her treatment cost. So I do not want to take risk by sending her to an unreliable employer,” said Mr Rahman.
He also acknowledged that most women are not trained properly before being sent to Saudi Arabia. “Whenever we try to set up training centers in Dhaka we run into regulatory hurdles,” he said. He urged the government to make it easier for the recruiting agencies to set up training centers.
 
‘Stop sending our women to Saudi’
Sumi Akter’s viral video has thrust the issue of female migrant abuse to the forefront of a nationwide debate.
Migrants’ rights groups and women’s rights advocates alike have urged the government to stop sending women as domestic help to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, a group of women’ rights activists under the banner “Bangladesh besides the Female Migrant Workers,” submitted a memorandum stating 13 demands, to the Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment.
In the parliament, Members of the opposition party urged the government to stop sending female workers to Saudi Arabia. “The media is abuzz with reports of abuse and exploitation of migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia. We want to know what steps the government has taken in saving these women from abuse,” asked Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haque Chunnu, who is also a former state minister for Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment.
In response, Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment Minister Imran Ahmed said the chargé d’affaires of the Saudi embassy in Dhaka was asked to raise the issue with the Saudi foreign ministry.
Another MP from The Jatiya Party, Kazi Firoz Rashid, accused the Bangladesh government and the Bangladesh Embassy in Saudi Arabia of negligence for failing to help the abused workers. “We are an independent nation and we have dignity. We cannot let this happen to our women. So I want a straight answer from the minister. When are you going to stop sending domestic workers to Saudi Arabia?” he asked.
Minister Imran, in response said, in the past three months the government had suspended licenses of 160 recruiting agencies and revoked three.
Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen on the other hand, while acknowledged that Bangladeshi female workers continue to suffer abuse while working in Saudi Arabia, refused to stop them from going to the country.
“We don’t want to prevent those women who want to go, because, in Bangladesh, men and women have equal rights. We refuse to treat women as second class citizens, and let them be left behind” the foreign minister told reporters last week in his office in Dhaka.
Meanwhile, on Friday Morning, Sumi Akter returned to Dhaka on a Saudi Airlines flight. After receiving her at the airport, officials of the Wage Earners’ Welfare Board (WEWB) sent her off to her parents’ house in Panchagarh’s Boda upazila.
After Sumi Akter’s video went viral, Bangladesh Consulate in Jeddah intervened in the matter. She was rescued by Saudi police but her employer refused to give her the ‘exit permit’ until he was paid back 22,000 riyals, which he claims he spent to hire Sumi Akter as housemaid. He was eventually forced by a Saudi labor court to give her the permission to go. The court also dismissed his plea for repayment.
Sumi Akter’s return marks the end of an almost six-month long ordeal for her. She went to Saudi Arabia on May 30."
Navigating the Hazards: A Close Look at Bangladesh Ship Breaking Industry,"The shipbreaking industry involves dismantling old and retired ships for scrap metal, has become a vital part of Bangladesh’s economy over the past few decades. At the same time, the ship breaking industry is a hazardous sector that poses significant risks to both workers and the environment. In this data blog, I will try to explore the challenges and opportunities that it presents.

Bangladesh is among the top five ship breaking countries globally, with 122 ships dismantled in 2022 within its borders
Size and Scope of the Industry

Based on the most recent available data, Bangladesh is among the top five ship breaking countries globally, with 122 ships dismantled in 2022 within its borders. This industry directly employs over 200,000 workers, with thousands more engaged in supporting industries (Bangladesh Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Foundation, 2019). Chittagong, a coastal city, is home to over 80% of all ship breaking yards in the country (Islam, 2020). Moreover, the ship breaking industry is a significant revenue earner for Bangladesh, generating nearly $1.5 billion each year (Mohammad, 2019).

Safety and Health Risks Faced by Workers

Despite the impressive economic returns, the ship breaking industry in Bangladesh comes with a high cost as it has an alarming rate of accidents and injuries. According to a 2019 report by the Bangladesh Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Foundation, there were at least 21 fatalities and 139 injuries recorded in the ship breaking industry that year alone. Regrettably, injured workers in the ship breaking industry in Bangladesh often receive meager compensation, with an average payout of just $430 for injuries sustained in 2018 (Zaman, 2018).

Lack of Regulation and Oversight

One of the most pressing issues confronting the ship breaking industry in Bangladesh is the lack of proper regulation and oversight. Despite the presence of laws and regulations designed to protect workers and the environment, the industry operates with minimal oversight from government agencies.

This lack of oversight has resulted in frequent environmental degradation and a high occurrence of accidents and injuries among workers. Furthermore, the absence of appropriate regulation and oversight has led to insufficient investments in safety equipment and training for workers (Mohammad, 2019).

Encouraging Developments

However, there are also encouraging developments in the ship breaking industry in Bangladesh. Many ship breakers are taking steps towards more environmentally sustainable practices. For example, some have initiated the recycling of materials and the responsible disposal of hazardous waste. Additionally, there is a growing interest in developing alternative, safer methods for ship breaking, such as using robots or other automated systems (Islam, 2020).

Ship breaking industry in Bangladesh is struggling with inadequate regulation and oversight, there is also potential for progress and innovation.
The ship breaking industry is a complex and multifaceted issue in Bangladesh, with both significant economic benefits and numerous environmental and health risks. Although the ship breaking industry in Bangladesh is struggling with inadequate regulation and oversight, there is also potential for progress and innovation.

By carefully analyzing the data and approaching the issue with thoughtfulness and nuance, we can strive towards creating a sustainable and secure future for this crucial sector in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh Healthcare System: A Tale of Two Realities,"
January 10, 2023
I will take a deep dive into the healthcare services of Bangladesh and compare the services between rural and urban areas in this blog post. Healthcare is a major concern for the Bangladesh, a small, developing country with a population of approximately 180 million. There is a significant disparity between rural and urban healthcare services.

Access to Healthcare Facilities

According to the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey 2014, there is a vast chasm between rural and urban areas. For a 100,000 population in urban areas, there are 3.3 hospitals, 21.9 clinics, and 6.4 diagnostic centers. In rural areas, there are 1.3 hospitals, 10.8 clinics, and 1.3 diagnostic centers for the same population (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2015).

This discrepancy in healthcare facilities is due to a need for more investment in rural healthcare infrastructure. Both the public and commercial sectors are to blame. The government frequently favors the metropolitan region, while the private sector is less likely to invest in rural healthcare facilities due to lower returns on investment.

Quality of Medical Care

An important factor determining the overall health care services of a country is the quality of medical care. Sadly, in Bangladesh the quality of medical care is much inferior in rural areas than in urban areas. According to the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, in rural areas, only 22% of deliveries were attended by a skilled birth attendant compared to 58% in urban areas. Furthermore, for children under 5 in rural areas, only 48% received treatment for acute respiratory infection compared to 70% in urban areas (National Institute of Population Research and Training, 2019).

This disparity in medical care between urban and rural areas can be directly attributed to the shortage of healthcare workers in rural areas. Healthcare workers are attracted to work in urban areas because of higher salaries, better working conditions, and other advanced facilities which are not present in rural areas.

The scarcity of healthcare professionals in rural areas creates a challenging situation, leading to the provision of lower-quality medical care to the rural population.. This phenomenon adds more burden to the rural population because they have to travel long distances to the cities to get better healthcare.

Health Status of the Population

Another significant indicator is the population's health status. Unfortunately, the population's health status is also much worse in rural areas compared to urban areas. The Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18 data reveals that the under-five mortality rate is 50 per 1,000 live births in rural areas, significantly higher than the corresponding figure of 31 per 1,000 live births in urban areas. 

Similarly, the infant mortality rate in rural areas is 39 per 1,000 live births compared to 22 per 1,000 live births in urban areas. Lack of access to healthcare facilities, low quality of medical care, and poor health education in rural areas are some of the reasons behind this disparity.

Another significant indicator is the population's health status. Unfortunately, the population's health status is also much worse in rural areas compared to urban areas.
It is evident from the above data that in Bangladesh, there is a significant gap in the availability of healthcare services between rural and urban areas. In comparison to urban areas, rural communities have fewer healthcare facilities, less medical services, and inferior health.

To guarantee that everyone in Bangladesh has equitable access to healthcare, the government and healthcare providers should prioritize resolving this disparity. Better research is also needed in this regard.

Insight into the Secondary School Teachers in Bangladesh,"The quality of secondary education in Bangladesh largely depends on the qualifications and experience of the teachers. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the distribution, qualification, and salary of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh. In this blog post, I will delve into this issue, drawing upon the latest data from various sources.

Distribution of Secondary School Teachers in Bangladesh

According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS), there were 536,634 secondary school teachers in the country as of 2020. Out of them, 246,112 were male, and 290,522 were female, which means that female teachers constitute more than half (54.1%) of the total secondary school teachers in Bangladesh.

The distribution of secondary school teachers varies significantly between divisions. Dhaka division has the highest number of secondary school teachers (102,188), followed by Chittagong division (75,839), and Rajshahi division (69,382). On the other hand, Rangpur division has the lowest number of secondary school teachers (38,559), followed by Barisal division (41,828).

Qualification of Secondary School Teachers in Bangladesh

According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS), Ministry of Education, the total number of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh is 536,634, out of which 58.9% hold a graduate degree (Grade 14), 29.1% hold a postgraduate degree (Grade 15), 2.8% hold an M.Phil/Ph.D. degree (Grade 16), and 9.2% have other qualifications.

The distribution of teachers by qualification varies across the different divisions of Bangladesh. Dhaka division has the highest number of secondary school teachers with a graduate degree (59,238) and the highest number with other qualifications (8,856). On the other hand, Chittagong division has the second-highest number of teachers with a graduate degree (41,463) and the second-highest number with other qualifications (7,973).

In terms of postgraduate degree holders, Dhaka division again tops the list with 30,957 teachers holding a postgraduate degree. Khulna division has the second-highest number of teachers with a postgraduate degree (17,478).

Meanwhile, Rajshahi division has the highest number of teachers holding an M.Phil/Ph.D. degree (1,959), followed by Chittagong division (2,642).

The table below summarizes the distribution of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh by qualification and division.

Salary of Secondary School Teachers in Bangladesh

The salary structure of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh is based on the National Pay Scale (NPS). The monthly salary of secondary school teachers varies depending on their qualifications, experience, and the location of the school. According to the latest NPS (2015), the salary of secondary school teachers ranges from BDT 12,500 (Grade 14, Entry-level Graduate teacher) to BDT 78,000 (Grade 16, Senior M.Phil/Ph.D. teacher).

However, it is important to note that the salary of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh is relatively low compared to their counterparts in other countries. According to a study by the World Bank, the average salary of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh is only 40% of the average salary of teachers in other South Asian countries.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the distribution, qualification, and salary of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh vary significantly between divisions. While the number of female teachers has increased over the years, the number of M.Phil/Ph.D. teachers is still very low. Furthermore, the salary of secondary school teachers in Bangladesh is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Therefore, it is essential to improve the quality of secondary education in Bangladesh by providing better training, support, and incentives to secondary school teachers."
State of road network in Bangladesh,"Road network is one of the key elements on which the development of a country hinges on. Often it is used as an index to assess the extent of a country’s development. A good road network plays important role in creating economic opportunities by integrating various local economies into national economies, reducing the cost of transportation of people and goods, and creating new jobs.

A well-developed road network also brings a host of social benefits by reducing poverty, bringing education and health services to underserved communities. Researchers also argue that rural road networks strengthen democracy and local civil society and encourage good governance and political inclusion.

Traditionally due to an abundance of rivers, Bangladesh had an extensive river based transport network. When the British colonial government introduced rail transportation system in mid-19th century, it become another popular mode of transport.

at the end of the British rule there were only a handful of kilometers of paved road, mostly concentrated in the urban areas, in Bangladesh.
 Although during the latter part of colonial rule the British government tried to improve the road transport system, it didn’t gain much traction due to WWII and at the end of the British rule there were only a handful of kilometers of paved road, mostly concentrated in the urban areas, in Bangladesh.

During the Pakistan period the government took some initiative through the three five-year plans to build more roads. Although these plans faced setbacks due to lack of funding, still nearly 6,500 km of roads were built under these plans. Nearly two-thirds of those were single lane paved road.

In independent Bangladesh after 1971 there was a renewed enthusiasm in building roads and road transport quickly became the most popular mode of transport both for freight and people.

Since then Bangladesh have been increasing its road network at a steady pace and at the end of 2021 the combined length of paved and unpaved road network of Bangladesh stood at 353,353 km, ranking the country 22nd in the world in terms of road length.

A Closer Look

Within Bangladesh, there is a wide variance in road length across the 64 districts. Chittagong tops the list with 14,073 km road while Meherpur sits at the bottom with merely 1,629 km road. It is worth noting that among the top 20 districts, 17 are those that were formed before the liberation of Bangladesh.

At division level Chittagong division takes the top spot with 69,774 km of road, followed by Dhaka division with 61,843 km. Sylhet takes the last spot with 22,412 km.

Road Density

While the size of road network in a particular area is an important matrix, it is not the be-all and end-all. Since districts have all different size of area so it is expected that physically bigger districts will have more roads.

For this reason it is important to take a look at the road density. Road density is the kilometers of road per 100 sq. km of land area. Here we see Jhalokati district tops the list with 555 km, followed by Dhaka and Feni.

All three hill districts: Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban have least amount of road length.

Road Per Capita

Yet another way to look at road network is to examine road length per capita matrix. Usually it is calculated as the length of road per 1000 people.

It should be noted that, except capital city Dhaka, the districts who have high population density are not the same districts with the most road density. In fact there appears to be an inverse relationship between road length per capita and population density.

Paved vs Unpaved

One important aspect of a road network is how much of it is paved or unpaved. In Bangladesh a little over one third of the road is paved. The other two third is officially called ‘earthen road’ by the Bangladesh government.

Rangamati, Patuakhali, Bandarban, Netrakona and Barguna, the top 5 districts with the most percentage of earthen roads, are either in hilly, coastal or border region. It is quite surprising to see that Dhaka, the most urbanized district of Bangladesh has more earthen road than paved road (55% vs 45%).

Road Quality Index

A discussion about road network will perhaps remain incomplete without mentioning the Road Quality Index published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) every year since 2006. It is a part of the Global Competitiveness Index published by WEF. The assessment is made up of data from WEF Executive Opinion Survey, a survey of over 14,000 business leaders in 144 countries.

Over the last 13 years Bangladesh slid down 35 spots and ended up at the 107th rank among 141 countries
The business leaders are asked to rate the roads in the country they operate on a scale from 1 to 7 in terms of extensiveness and condition of the road, where 1 means underdeveloped and 7 means extensive and efficient by international standard. The final composite score of a country is produced by aggregating the individual responses.

In 2006 Bangladesh ranked 72 among 119 countries. Over the last 13 years Bangladesh slid down 35 spots and ended up at the 107th rank among 141 countries in 2019. Other south Asian countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bhutan all consistently rank higher than Bangladesh.

Bangladesh will officially join the middle income country group in 2026. Furthermore the country also plan to be a developed country by 2041. In the light of these stated goals of Bangladesh, the experts warn that the country should be very wary of avoiding the middle income trap.

When a country’s growth become stagnated due to its inability to transform from a resource driven growth to productivity driven growth it’s assumed that the country is caught in the middle income trap. Malaysia, Brazil and South Africa are few glaring examples of such predicaments.

Researchers believe that a good road transportation network is crucial in sustaining the growth momentum once a country achieve middle income status. Keeping that in mind, Bangladesh need a long term vision regarding its road network.

Additionally, a good road network will also be crucial if the country want unlock the full potential of its connectivity with Asian Road Network and Belt and Road Initiative.

At the same time, as Bangladesh is opening up more and more areas, often ecologicaly sensitive regions, to development, it is of vital importance that issues like effects of road network on ecological conditions enter into the development conversation."
Where to buy an apartment in Dhaka in 2022?,"If you are in the market to buy buy an apartment in Dhaka then good luck finding one for less than 70,00,000 taka.

That is the median price of an apartment in the first quarter of 2022 based on my analysis of nearly 9000 apartments for sale on bproperty.com, the most popular Bangladeshi website for real estate listing.

The analysis revealed some interesting aspects regarding the current real estate market of Dhaka.

What is the median price per square foot?

In terms of price per square foot (ppsf), the median hovers around 5500 taka. But if we take a more granular look at the data then things take some dramatic turns. For Gulshan area the median ppsf soars all the way to 15445 taka, highest in the city. On the other hand Mohamamdpur have the lowest ppsf at 4875 taka.

What is the average apartment size?

Median size of an apartment in Dhaka is 1270 square feet (sqft). But that number more than doubles in Gulshan area (2667 sqft) which has the largest median apartment size in the city.

On the other hand, at 1235 sqft, Mohamamdpur area has the smallest apartments. Interestingly when it comes to unit price (price per square-feet) Gulshan and Mohammadpur also fall at the opposite ends of the spectrum, with Gulshan being the most highly priced.

It is a rather puzzling revelation because in most other megacities, small apartments can be found even in the priciest neighborhood, as evidenced in this article, making those neighborhood somewhat affordable for people who wants to sacrifice space for location.

Where are the small apartments?

Outside of Gulshan and Banani, the apartments get dramatically small. As mentioned above, Mohamamdpur has the smallest apartments. In Mirpur, Badda, Adabor and Banasree the size gets slightly bigger.

Where are the cheapest apartments?

As we have observed in the analysis that both the actual apartment price and the price per unit is highly and positively correlated with apartment size in Dhaka so it is no wonder that you’ll find the cheapest apartment in the area where the smallest apartments are. And those areas are Mohammadur, Adabpr, Mirpur, Badda and Banasree. Apartment price in these areas hover between 60-80 lakh.

What about the priciest apartments?

Almost all the priciest apartments of this list in concentrated in Gulshan and Dhanmondi area. With few others in Banani, Bashundhara R-A and Baridhara.

How does Dhaka fare against Indian cities?

Since Bangladesh an India has comparable income per capita, it is reasonable to compare the apartment prices of Dhaka to some of the megacities of India.

Initially I attempted to compare the average apartment size and price per square-feet between Dhaka and 5 most populous Indian cities but there are not any reliable and up-to-date data regarding the average apartment size of the Indian cities.

Conclusion

A better in depth analysis could be performed if real estate data from previous years were available. It is impossible to extract key trends and patterns without quarterly or yearly data. For instance, pre-COVID real estate data would help shed light on the effect of COVID on real estate price in Dhaka. And with farther analysis of building material costs, the driver behind the cost increase or reduction could also be identified."
Rising Air Pollution in Bangladeshi Urban Centers,"In most developing countries like Bangladesh, air pollution is a growing concern. Rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in heightened levels of air pollution, particularly in the urban areas in Bangladesh. The adverse health effects of air pollution, such as respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, significantly impact public health and the country’s economy. In this data blog, I use data and visualizations to explore the current air pollution status in Bangladesh’s urban centers.

According to the World Air Quality Report 2021, Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, was ranked as the world’s third-most polluted city, with an average annual PM2.5 concentration of 77.1 _g/m_ in 2020. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter, a major contributor to air pollution and can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Other major cities in Bangladesh, such as Chattogram, Narayanganj, and Gazipur, also have high levels of air pollution.

Moreover, Bangladesh’s air quality index (AQI) regularly exceeds the safe limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO), which is 50 _g/m_ for PM2.5. In 2020, the average annual AQI in Dhaka was 166, which is considered unhealthy. The AQI levels in other major cities in Bangladesh were also above the safe limit.

Several factors contribute to air pollution in Bangladesh’s urban centers, including industrialization, transportation, and brick kilns. Bangladesh’s rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to an increase in the number of factories and industries which emit harmful pollutants into the air. The transportation sector, particularly the high number of road vehicles, also contributes significantly to air pollution. Furthermore, brick kilns, a significant source of particulate matter emissions, contribute to air pollution in Bangladesh.

Air pollution is a growing concern in Bangladesh’s urban centers, with high levels of PM2.5 and AQI exceeding safe limits. The adverse health effects of air pollution require immediate action. The government of Bangladesh and relevant stakeholders should take measures to reduce emissions from industries, transportation, and brick kilns and promote clean energy sources."
A Closer Look at Digital Divide in Bangladesh,"With the rapid growth of technology in recent years, there is a growing digital divide between urban and rural areas in Bangladesh. This digital divide can have severe implications for various sectors, including economic development, education, healthcare, and others. In this data blog, we will analyze the extent of the digital divide in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh, its implications for various sectors, and explore potential solutions to bridge the gap.

Mobile and Internet Penetration

Bangladesh has seen a rapid growth in mobile phone penetration, with over 184 million mobile phone subscribers as of 2022. The mobile phone penetration rate in Bangladesh is approximately 111%, which means that there are more mobile phones than people in the country. However, when it comes to internet penetration, there is a significant divide between urban and rural areas. According to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, the internet penetration rate in urban areas was around 83% in December 2020, while in rural areas, it was only around 59%. This means that approximately 40% of the rural population in Bangladesh does not have access to the internet.

Computer Usage

Computer usage is still not widespread in rural areas of Bangladesh. According to a survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, only around 1.7% of households in rural areas own a computer, while in urban areas, the percentage is much higher at around 18.8%.

Implications for Various Sectors

The digital divide in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh can have severe implications for various sectors, including economic development, education, healthcare, and agriculture.

Economic Development: The digital divide can severely impact economic development in rural areas. With limited access to information technology, businesses in rural areas are at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts in urban areas. This can lead to slower economic growth in rural areas.

Education: The digital divide can also impact the quality of education in rural areas. Students in urban areas have access to a wide range of online resources, while students in rural areas have limited access. This difference in access to information can widen the gap in educational outcomes between urban and rural areas.

Healthcare: With the growth of telemedicine and online health services, the internet has become an essential tool for healthcare. However, the digital divide can severely impact the quality of healthcare in rural areas. Patients in rural areas have limited access to online health services, which can affect their health outcomes.

Agriculture: Agriculture is a critical sector in Bangladesh, employing a significant portion of the workforce. However, the lack of access to information technology can severely impact the productivity of farmers in rural areas. Farmers in urban areas have access to online resources, which can help them improve their farming practices and increase productivity.

Potential Solutions

To bridge the digital divide in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh, the government can take several steps. One of the most crucial steps is to improve internet infrastructure in rural areas. The government can work with private companies to provide internet services in rural areas at affordable rates. Additionally, the government can invest in training programs to teach digital skills to people in rural areas.

Another potential solution is to provide subsidies to households in rural areas to purchase computers. This can help improve computer usage in rural areas and reduce the digital divide between urban and rural areas.

Conclusion

The digital divide in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh can have severe implications for various sectors, including economic development, education, healthcare, and agriculture. While there has been rapid growth in mobile phone penetration in Bangladesh, there is still a significant gap in internet and computer usage between urban and rural areas. This gap can limit the potential for economic growth in rural areas, impact the quality of education and healthcare, and reduce the productivity of farmers.

To bridge the digital divide, the government and private companies need to work together to improve internet infrastructure in rural areas and provide affordable internet services. Additionally, training programs and subsidies can help improve digital skills and computer usage in rural areas. By bridging the digital divide, Bangladesh can improve economic growth, enhance the quality of education and healthcare, and increase productivity in the agricultural sector."
